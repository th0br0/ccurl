# ccurl
C port of the Curl library

## Usage

Don't forget to grab submodules! use `git submodule update --init --recursive` 
when cloning, and `git submodule update --recursive` when pulling from this 
repository.

### To Compile

    CMake is a build dependency. If you are testing, you must also
    install CUnit (BCUnit).

#### Unix-based (linux, mac, etc.)

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . &&  cd ..`

#### Windows

You may build using mingw or cygwin, but if you build with Visual C++, it is
highly recommended that you also install the 
[LLVM compiler](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html), and Microsoft's [Build Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159).


```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -A x64 -T LLVM-vs2014 ..
cmake --build . --config Release
cd ..
```

In Windows, the libraries would be located in the build\Release directory.

### Command-line programs

There are two included command-line programs, ccurl-cli, and ccurl-digest. Usage 
is as follows:

`% ccurl-digest $(ccurl-cli <MinWeightMagnitude> <TransactionTrytes>)`

where `<MinWeightMagnitude>` is replaced with, for example, 18, and 
`<TransactionTrytes>` is replaced with your 2673-length transaction.

#### Tricks

If using GPU acceleration, you may tune the loop length with 
`ccurl_pow_set_loop_count(my_loop_count);` with the library, or 
setting an environment variable to, for example, `CCURL_LOOP_COUNT=64`, when 
using ccurl-cli.
